We want to make several different types of layers.
A layer exists over multiple frames.

We want to declare some shared properties between different layers.
    - Position. It seems like we want each layer to have a definitive position.

Layer types
    - Hitboxes
        - Shape
        - Knockback
        - Stun
        - Damage
    - Hurtboxes
        - Shape
    - Events 
        - A string that gets passed from the animator on a frame transition.
        - Indicates to whatever is calling the animator that it should take some kind of predefined special event.
    - Spline curves
        - I believe we will use the spline curves to dictate how particle effects are drawn.
        - Therefore, each point on the spline curve should exist only on one layer.

Layer meta types
    - Frame layers: Hitbox / Hurtbox layers
    - In-between frame layers:
        - Events (which should only happen on frame transitions)
        - Possibly spline curves
        - It seems we want these to be named. We should enforce name uniqueness.

Splines
    - It appears we want splines to be used for particle effects. Probably shouldn't be a hardcoded enum.
    - Should be a string name.
    - Animator reads string name and uses that to draw the right kinds of particles.
    - It's the animation player's job to decide how to interpolate over the spline.

Frame data
    - Frame duration (in milliseconds)
    - If an attack is cancellable
        - This seems incredibly specific. I don't know if we want this to be in the animator. 
        - We could possibly just have a boolean type layer and the player code looks for a layer with a specific string name.
    - Root motion
        - We also need a fixed point as the origin of the root motion. 
        - Right now we are using the first point of the animation as the basis for the root motion. This might be fine.
